<h2> Cassava Leaf Disease Detection </h2>

<h3>
  This was my final year project of MCA. For this project I used dataset available at Kaggle, that included 27000 
              images of 5 cassava disease infected plants. I trained my model on various architectures such as VGG-16, VGG-19, Mobilenet encompassing some 
          	  chnages to the models. I also used transfer learning technique for training, which gave me the best results
