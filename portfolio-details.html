              <li><strong>Details</strong> : This project was assigned to me during my training cum internship at IBM. During this project I was given a
              large dataset of bitcoin that had 2099760 tuples. This dataset had a lot of invalid values as well, that increased the challange of data
              cleaning. In this project I used libraries like seaborn for data visualization purpose. <br>After visualization I realized the patterns in the
          	  dataset were needed to be visualized based on the correlation. This lead me to the conclusion that, the linear regression algorithm would give
          	  me the desired results.<br> I decided to go with features such as opening price, highest price lowest price and volume of the bitcoin. As output
          	  feature I took the closing price. <br> Then I used linear regression algorithm from sklearn library for training. <br> This model gave the testing
          	  accuracy of 99%</li>

MPLAD is initiative by Indian Government for enabling the citizens to communicate the dificulties that they are facing directly to the members of parliament. During this project I learned various components of android framework and various ways of designing attractive user interface. I was working on SQLite database for backend of this application. I also worked on JSON parser while working on this project.</li>

              <li><strong>Details</strong> : This project was originally intended to be used by Konkan Railway Coroporation Limited. This project is based on
              	IOT and android. In this project I have used arduino UNO board with HC-05 bluetooth module as a hardware component. This system was designed to automate the task of generation of private number (PN) by station master and the gateman. <br> Working: <br> 1. The station master sees the 
              	coming train and uses this application to generate a private number by entering train number and sends it to the gateman<br> 2. Gateman
              	receives the number generated by station master. Now gateman closes the gate and makes sure no vehicle passes the rail track until the train
              	is passed. <br> Then only after he has closed the gate, now he can generate acknowledge the number sent by station master and generate his
              	own private number. <br> 4. Once the train passes the gate, gateman now opens the gate, and the he enters the time at which train has passed
              	and commits the communication</li>

              <li><strong>Details</strong> : This was my very first machine learning project. I worked on this project during the "Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 
              	2020 competition along with a team of 6 people. The dataset for this project was not available on the internet, so we had to obtain it using 
              	various web scraping tools such as bing image downloader. We also manually downloaded some images. <br> Then we worked to develop a machine 
              	learning model with tensorflow keras library. The accuracy obtained for this dataset was 91% on validation dataset and 96% on the training 
              	dataset. <br> After creating the model, we worked on the android application. For this we used various libraries like tflite and picaso. During 
                this project I learned playing with permissions in android. I encountered some errors and bugs but over the time I was able to fix them.The 
            	project is uploaded on github as well.</li>

              of recording faculty profiles in more efficient way. The older way of keeping faculty information was keeping their resumes on the college 
              server. Faculty management system changes this way completely. It allows faculty of college to have their profiles created on the server by 
      		  themseleves and then generate the resumes on  the go. The faculty has to enter the information such as past teaching experience, publications
      		  , conferences etc. This information would be saved at the server end whenever faculty wants to convert his profile into resume, the system would
      		retrive this information and present the same in neat format</li>

              dificult part in the process but I was able to complete that. After that to add more functionality, I provided facility to click on each element 
              of the table to get detailed information about it. It included information such as the group to which it belongs, atomic weight etc. I also 
          	  provided facility to hear the pronunciation of the name of the element.</li>
